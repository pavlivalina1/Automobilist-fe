  "FAQQuestion1": "How is learning at a driving school?",
  "FAQAnswer1": "In the educational process of the driving school, two main courses are distinguished: theoretical and practical. During the theoretical course, together with teachers and instructors, you will review traffic rules, penalties for traffic violations, safety rules, first aid, and basic technical aspects of the car. After completing the theoretical part, you move on to practical classes, starting with the autodrome. There you have to master the control of the car, understand its dimensions, and get the first driver's skills, including starting, turning, parking, and stopping on a hill. After the autodrome, practical training continues on city roads, where you will encounter real traffic situations, cars, traffic lights, and other elements.
